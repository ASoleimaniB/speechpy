Introduction
============

The purpose of this project is to provide a package for speech processing and
feature extraction.

-----------
Motivation
-----------

There are different motivations for this open source project.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Deep Learning application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the main reasons for creating this package was to provide necessary features for deep learning applications such as ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition) or SR(Speaker Recognition).
As a results, most of the features that are necessary are provided hear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pythonic Packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another reason for creating this package was to have a Pythonic environment for
speech recognition and feature extraction due to the fact that the Python language
is becoming ubiquotous!
